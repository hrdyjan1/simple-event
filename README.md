# Simple Event App

Simple Event is a React Native application for managing and viewing events effortlessly. This app allows users to explore event details, manage schedules, and stay organized.

## Features

- **Event Management**: Add, edit, and view event details.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on Android and iOS.
- **Web Build**: Access the web version of the app [here](https://simple-event.netlify.app/).

### Hesitations

- dashboard vs event
- create event (startAt === time + date)
- create event/event detail different input order
- password eye off/on reverse
- sign up password eye is missing
- what about no capacity action button
- data status loading, error, ...
- empty values
- handling errors
- go back from nested screens
- create event success message?

### Todo

- eslint
- prettier
- theme (colors, spaces, shadows, ...)
- rename event-simple to eventio
- sync icons
- remove - createDashboardDetail and stuffs
- prevent duplicity - f.e. create event (p.s. debounce)
- keyboard avoid view
